                    <b>Why UnicoCampania?</b> <br><br>App redesign was the main theme and goal of a solo-project. <br>It
                    was
                    my
                    first
                    approach at
                    redesign and it was confusing at first and I had to think a lot
                    about
                    the right app I was going to choose as a study subject.
                    <br>I've decided to use the UnicoCampania (iOS) App for multiple reasons. <br>First of all, it's
                    an
                    app
                    I daily use, even more times per day, which means I know quite well how the user-flow works and
                    I was able to detect the main flaws in a short time. Another reason is strongly connected to my
                    learning goals, which is why I've asked myself what I wanted to learn by working on this project
                    and
                    with this app. Last but not the least, UnicoCampania, even in its iOS version, doesn't
                    follow
                    the HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) and it's quite far from any Apple native app.
                    <br><br><b>Research and design</b>
                    <br><br>After a first phase based on decision-making, my research started. As I mentioned
                    earlier, I
                    knew the app quite well, but I've still decided to explore it in a deeper and broader way.
                    That's
                    how I've realised there were two main call to actions when it comes to ticket: check the ticket
                    you
                    have bought already and buy a new one.
                    <br><br>Now, let's move to the issues. The whole app user-flow was confusing in various parts,
                    with
                    different buttons leading to the same action and too many taps required to get simple tasks
                    done,
                    such as just opening your active ticket to make it be checked on the train.
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                    <b>Goal</b>
                    <br><br>
                    As a project goal, I've decided to design an app that was able to give you access to your
                    tickets
                    in
                    just one tap.
                    <br>In addition, 3 tabs can be found and seen in the tab bar: tickets and, the two newly added,
                    parking
                    and
                    sharing.
                    <br>The first tab the user can see when opening the app is the Tickets tab, where you can buy
                    tickets by choosing
                    the most
                    useful
                    pattern among: finding a solution by inserting a departure and a destination, checking timetables,
                    searching
                    for all
                    the
                    companies affiliated with Unico.
                    <br><br><b>Development</b>
                    <br><br>After a couple of lo-fi prototypes and multiple hand-drawn sketches, I've created the first
                    hi-fi protoype of the app, by using Figma as an editing and prototyping software.
                    <br>I've decided to implement the front-end side of the Tickets tab and that's when the
                    Figma prototype became an app, running on an iPhone, too.
                    <br>In this first task I gave myself, I had the chance to explore Swift and SwiftUI, using native
                    components and trying to apply what I was learning about the Apple's HIG.
                    <br>I've used a horizontal scrollview for the "My tickets" section and a list of cards in the "Buy a
                    Ticket" section.
                    <br>When I've completed this task, I've realised I wanted to do more and to learn more, which is why
                    I've also implemented a full-screen modal that can be openend just by tapping on a bought ticket and
                    that will display all the ticket informations, its state and a QR code.
                    <br>The QR code is generated from a string (linked to the user) and a random alphanumeric sequence
                    to simulate it uniqueness, by using CoreImage framework. Its functionality is also enhanced by the
                    use of a timer: the code can be refreshed both manually, by tapping the "Refresh" button, or
                    automatically, each time the timer expires.</br>
