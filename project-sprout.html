        <div class="body-text">Sprout is a 2D, pixel-art-styled arcade game that will allow you to dive into a
          captivating
          dystopian world.
          <br>In this thrilling adventure, you'll embark on a mission to protect the last surviving creature on a dying
          Earth, a
          little sprout, from
          hordes of robotic bugs that threaten its existence.
          <br>
          <br>Sprout was developed by a team of four, two developers and two designers/game artists, during a two-weeks
          project at the Apple Developer Academy, hence the choice to develop a game for iphone only. <br><br>
          <b>Gameplay</b>
          <br><br>In this game, you'll get to be the guardian of the sprout, using your reflexes and strategic
          thinking to stop the relentless waves of robotic bugs and destroy them all before they kill your harmless
          protégé.
          <br>Using your iOS
          mobile device, you
          can swipe on
          the screen to attack the enemies and earn points, but be prepared for a relentless challenge as their
          numbers
          increase, and their speed
          intensifies.
          <br>In addition, each time a bug will complete its letal mission, the sprout will lose a live and,
          consequently,
          one of its 3
          leaves, retiring back in the
          man-hole (or <i>sprout-hole!</i>)
          and then coming back up. <br>When the sprout will have lost all its
          lives/leaves,
          the game will end as the sprout will die for good.
          <br>
          <br><b>Game mechanics and contributions</b><br>
          <br>As one of the two developers of our team, I took charge of coding the main mechanics of the game. This
          involved implementing the spawning of the enemies as well as
          their
          eventual demise. <br>Indeed, the robotic bugs will enter the scene with a
          certain
          quantity of randomness, from different starting positions and at varying speeds, which means
          their arrival
          won't be
          predictable.<br>When it comes to the death of the enemies, I've developed the swipe gesture recognition
          system,
          enabling the player to intuitively interact with the game, as well as the scoring system (+10 points for
          each
          killed bug) and the increasing complexity of the gameplay, making the enemies' attack faster and stronger
          because of the incremented number of bugs.
          <br>
          <br><b>Technologies</b><br>
          <br>Sprout was developed in Xcode, respecting the boundaries we were given for
          this project - which was aimed at creating a solution for the iOS/Apple environment only.
          <br>Therefore, to create this adventure, our team used Swift as a programming language and SpriteKit as
          a native tool for game development. SpriteKit is a versatile and feature-rich framework, useful to
          implement
          visual effects, animations and physics-based interactions, making the game
          come alive on your iOS device.
