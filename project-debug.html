                    <br>"Debug" is a 2D game for macOS, developed in Unity as a brief revival of the 70's arcade game,
                    Snake
                    - previously Blockade.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Gameplay and game mechanics</b>
                    <br><br>As in the classic snake-genre games, the player can control the snake using the keyboard to
                    find
                    and eat its food - a bug, in this version, hence the chosen game title.
                    The player gets 100 points for each bug the snake eats, while the snake gets longer and longer. The
                    speed of the game increases the more bugs are eaten to make the game more entertaining and harder.
                    There's only one limitation: if the snake bites itself, it will die!
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Setting and visual</b><br>
                    <br>The game area is a rectangular space where the snake moves around, while the bugs keep spawning
                    in random positions of the
                    screen. The game features a cartoon-style graphics I've designed using Figma.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Technologies</b><br>
                    <br>The whole game was developed in Unity and it uses various 2D assets and Unity components such as
                    Sprite Renderer, Box Collider 2D, Rigid Body, Text Mesh Pro and other UI elements. A key element was
                    the Unity input system, which drives the entire core game mechanic and gameplay.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Process</b><br>
                    <br>This project was created as part of a two-week challenge centered around game creation, where I
                    mostly focused on (back-end) game development, which allowed me to explore a bit more about Unity,
                    while refreshing my knowledge of C# programming.
