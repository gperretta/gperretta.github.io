                    Debug is a nostalgic 2D game designed specifically for macOS, paying homage to the 70's arcade
                    game, Snake, formerly known as Blockade. <br><br>Entirely developed in one week, Debug was born the
                    product
                    solo project
                    for the Game Creation Experience offered by the
                    Apple
                    Developer Academy.<br><br>
                    <b>Gameplay and game mechanics</b>
                    <br><br>Drawing inspiration from the traditional snake-genre games, Debug allows players to take
                    control of the snake using the keyboard arrows. There's a simple goal: guiding the
                    snake to find and eat its prey, represented by a bug - hence the game title choice for this
                    alternative mini-game.
                    <br>For each bug successfully eaten, the players will be rewarded with 100 points to be
                    added to their score.
                    <br>However,
                    as
                    the snake feeds, it gradually grows longer, posing an additional challenge to the player's
                    navigation skills. Additionally, the game dynamically
                    increases in speed as more bugs are consumed, making it progressively more entertaining and
                    challenging.
                    <br>There's only one vital (or deadly) constraint: the snake shall not bite itself or it will die.
                    <br>Players must exercise caution and
                    skillfully maneuver the serpent to avoid a self-inflicted
                    death, as each collision between different parts of the snake's body results in an unfortunate end
                    to the game.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Technologies</b><br>
                    <br>Debug was developed in Unity, leveraging C# scripting, original 2D assets and a variety of
                    Unity components and features, including Sprite
                    Renderer, Box Collider 2D, Rigid Body, Text Mesh Pro, and other UI elements, to create an intuitive
                    and visually appealing experience. <br>One of the key elements that drives the entire core game
                    mechanic
                    and gameplay is the Unity input system, which enables seamless control of the
                    snake's movement using the keyboard, giving the players the power to navigate through the game
                    world with
                    precision and responsiveness. The integration of the Unity input system ensures that
                    players can fully immerse themselves in this unusual quest.
                    <br>I've also had the chance to explore my design skills
                    by crafting
                    from scratch all the assets of the game, using Figma as a design tool and
                    editor, giving Debug a funny yet simple cartoon-style.
