          the Apple
          Developer Academy.
          <br>The Academy it's been such an amazing experience and an intense journey, where I've been given the
          chance to improve my technical skills and to develop soft skills the most.
          <br><b>Bonus point:</b> at the ADA, I've met so many people, even coming from different parts of the world
          and
          I've been able to mentally travel around just by hearing their stories and listening to their experiences.
          Awesome, isn't it?
          <br><br>In the meantime, I'm a freelance software tester for an international platform and tested 60+
          products
          available on the market. I can't say any clients' name, but you sure have heard at least 2 or 3 of them!
          <br><br>
          However, don't get me wrong, I like my free time, too.
          <br>I enjoy walking around, most of all, I love going to places where I can see the sea. I'm also a
          binge-watcher and I like every kind of tv shows and movies, from romantic comedies to sci-fi.

              <br> A first attempt at app redesign. <b>Case study:</b> UnicoCampania iOS App.
              <br>
              <br> This two-weeks project was mainly aimed at practicing more with the iOS
              Human Interface Guidelines,
              exploring
              SwiftUI and the use of native components. <br>
              After a brief study of the app user-flow, I've implemented the UI of the main call to
              actions
              about tickets: check/validate your
              active tickets and buy a new one. <br>
              The final redesigned app contains: <br> - a horizontal scrollview to display multiple active tickets,
              <br> - a list for the three
              paths to buy a new ticket and a full-screen modal for ticket validation,
              <br> - a unique QR code, that can be reloaded both manually by the user
              and automatically with a timer.
