        <div class="body-text">I'm a Computer Engineering grad student in Naples (Italy) and I'm currently a learner
          at
          the Apple
          Developer Academy.
          <br>The Academy it's been such an amazing experience and an intense journey, where I've been given the
          chance to improve my technical skills and to develop soft skills the most.
          <br><b>Bonus point:</b> at the Academy, I've met so many people, even coming from different parts of the world
          and
          I've been able to mentally travel around just by hearing their stories and listening to their experiences.
          Awesome, isn't it?
          <br><br>In the meantime, I'm a freelance software tester for an international platform and tested 60+
          products
          available on the market. I can't say any clients' name, but you sure have heard at least 2 or 3 of them!
          <br><br>
          However, don't get me wrong, I like my free time, too.
          <br>I enjoy walking around, most of all, I love going to places where I can see the sea. I'm also a
          binge-watcher and I like every kind of tv shows and movies, from romantic comedies to sci-fi.
          <br>
          <b>A maybe uncommon passion of mine: </b>ancient Greek tragedies and comedies!
