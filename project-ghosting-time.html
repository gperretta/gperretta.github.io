                    <b>Gameplay and game mechanics</b>
                    <br><br>Ghosting Time is an arcade-style casual game in which the player controls Gary the little
                    ghost on a side-scroller space.
                    The player will guide the ghost through pairs of Hell-fire-topped columns (one on top, one on
                    the bottom) apperaing at random heights and with the same distance between each other. <br>The ghost
                    will automatically go
                    down and it will go higher when the players tap on the space bar only.
                    <br>Each pair of obstacles avoided will increase the players' score of 1 point.
                    <br>If the ghost
                    accidentally collides with one of the obstacles, the poor Gary will fall down going back to Hell and
                    the game will end.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Technologies</b><br>
                    <br>The game was developed in Unity and it uses C# scripting and multiple Unity components such as
                    Rigid
                    Body 2D to
                    implement ghost physics, Box Collider 2D for collisions, Sprite
                    Renderer, mutiple-sprites Animation for ghost idle movements, new TextMeshPro GUI and Button for the
                    UI.
                    <br>I've also had a bit of fun in Figma, an editing tool, to create all the assets, including the
                    two frames for the ghost idle animation, the obstacles and the night sky as background.
