          <b>The idea</b>
          <br><br>
          DriveLink allows long-distance drivers to talk with each other, share tips and feel connected
          while
          being alone!
          <br>With DriveLink, driving for an extensive time becomes a social experience, providing a
          much-needed break from the monotony and boredom of the open road.
          <br>The whole project was inspired by the CB Radio used by truck drivers to communicate with each
          other to exchange useful informations about roads, traffic and weather.
          <br><br>The app concept was validated through a long research phase, which lately became a design
          and
          development test-driven process for a team-project.

          <b>How it works?</b>
          <br>
          <br>DriveLink works with a match-and-call system, which means that each user has the chance to select
          some topics of interest and make a call.
          To use the app, the user should be logged-in. Indeed, the first time the app will be launched, after a brief
          tutorial,
          a sign-in screen will be the first screen the user will see. If the user has no account yet, it will be easy
          to sign-up by tapping a link at the bottom of the screen and filling the registration form.
          <br><br>
          <b>Testing</b>
          <br><br>
          During the development process, multiple builds of the app were released on
          TestFlight, an Apple app specifically aimed at testing.
          <br>Both internal and external testing sessions were conducted, focusing on usability,
          registration flow and localisation.
          Indeed, the app was localised and with a multi-language support in three
          languages:
          Italian, English and Spanish.
          <br><br>
          <b>Technologies</b>
          <br><br>
          DriveLink was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and multiple additional
          frameworks. We combined SwiftUI and UIKit for the app interface, used CallKit framework as a calling
          system, experimented with CloudKit for the database and persistence aspect of the app and with
          Firebase Authentication service for sign-in and sign-up.
          <br>However, the app we developed is currently a demo version only.
          <br>Making calls has its cost and as far as we looked for a free VoIP service, we had to take a step
          back, acknowledging our limited resources.
          <br><br>
          <b>Personal contribution</b>
          <br><br>
          My main tasks revolved around the implementation of the sign-in/sign-up feature with the
          development of the login and registration screens and the authentication system, adding a multi-language
          support for localisation
          and
          text
          field
          checks using regular expressions (RegEx).
