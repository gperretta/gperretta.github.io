          <b>The idea</b>
          <br><br>
          DriveLink allows long-distance drivers to talk with each other, share tips and feel connected
          while
          being alone!
          <br>With DriveLink, driving for an extensive time becomes a social experience, providing a
          much-needed break from the monotony and boredom of the open road.
          <br>The whole project was inspired by the CB Radio used by truck drivers to communicate with each
          other to exchange useful informations about roads, traffic and weather - and to have a little
          company while working, too!
          <br><br>The app concept was validated through a long research phase, which lately became a design
          and
          development test-driven process for a team-project.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <b>How it works?</b>
          <br><br>
          First of all, in order to use the app the user should be logged in. After
          an onboarding tutorial displayed for the first time only, the user will directly land on a login
          screen, where it's possible to insert mail and password. If the user has no account yet, it's easy
          to sign-up just by tapping a link at the bottom of the screen and then filling all the required
          fields showed in the registration screen.
          <br>After this sign-in/sign-up process, it is now possible to use the app. How?
          <br>DriveLink works with a match-and-call system, which means that each user has the chance to select
          some topics of interest and make a call. The system will start looking for a perfect match who is
          online and ready to talk and shares the same interests or some of them. In the case there are no
          users available sharing the
          selected interests, the match will be random to guarantee a working service, even partial.
          <br><br>
          <b>Testing</b>
          <br><br>
          During the development process, multiple builds of the app were released on
          TestFlight, an Apple app specifically aimed at testing.
          <br>Both internal and external testing sessions were conducted, focusing on usability,
          registration flow and localisation.
          Indeed, the app was localised and with a multi-language support in three
          languages:
          Italian, English and Spanish.
          <br><br>
          <b>Technologies</b>
          <br><br>
          DriveLink was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and multiple additional
          frameworks. We combined SwiftUI and UIKit for the app interface, used CallKit framework as a calling
          system, experimented with CloudKit for the database and persistence aspect of the app and with
          Firebase Authentication service for sign-in and sign-up.
          <br>However, the app we developed is currently a demo version only.
          <br>Making calls has its cost and as far as we looked for a free VoIP service, we had to take a step
          back, acknowledging our limited resources.
          <br>We still had the chance to explore external services such as Twilio and SandBird, although we
          couldn't
          use them for a product aimed at being on the market without an appropriate economic
          support.
          <br><br>
          <b>Personal contribution</b>
          <br><br>
          My main tasks revolved around the implementation of the sign-in/sign-up feature with the
          development of the login and registration screens and the authentication system, adding a multi-language
          support for localisation
          and
          text
          field
          checks using regular expressions (RegEx).
          <br><br>
          <b>A note about safety</b>
          <br><br>
          As I've mentioned before, the current app version is a demo.
          Future implementation of the app could include some features or adaptions for the user safety.
          For safety reason, the call would always be on speaker. If the user has the earphones on,
          only
          one of
          them would be transmitting sounds.
          Furthermore, a specific car-mode could be implemented in the app, to allow the user to
          only
          make calls without having access to any other feature that may be distracting.
          <br>Making the app
          work
          with
          Siri could be useful, too, using SiriKit framework, to allow the user to make a call in the app just with a
          vocal
          command.
          <br>Another possibility would be turning DriveLink into an app working on Apple's CarPlay only.
