                    <b>The idea</b>
                    <br><br>
                    DriveLink allows long-distance drivers to talk with each other, share tips and feel connected
                    while
                    being alone!
                    <br>With DriveLink, driving for an extensive time becomes a social experience, providing a
                    much-needed break from the monotony and boredom of the open road.
                    <br>The whole project was inspired by the CB Radio used by truck drivers to communicate with each
                    other to exchange useful informations about roads, traffic and weather - and to have a little
                    company while working, too!
                    <br><br>The app concept was validated through a long research phase, which lately became a design
                    and
                    development test-driven process for a team-project.
                </div>
                <div class="body-text">
                    <b>How it works?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    First of all, in order to use the app the user should be logged in. After
                    an onboarding tutorial displayed for the first time only, the user will directly land on a login
                    screen, where it's possible to insert mail and password. If the user has no account yet, it's easy
                    to sign-up just by tapping a link at the bottom of the screen and then filling all the required
                    fields showed in the registration screen.
                    <br>After this sign-in/sign-up process, it is now possible to use the app. How?
                    <br>DriveLink works with a match-and-call system, which means that any user has the chance to select
                    some topics of interest and make a call. The system will start looking for a perfect match who is
                    online and ready to talk and share the same interests or some of them. In the case there are no
                    users available sharing the
                    selected interests, the match will be random to guarantee a working service, even partial.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Testing</b>
                    <br><br>
                    During the development process, multiple builds of the app were released on
                    TestFlight, an Apple app specifically aimed at testing.
                    <br>Both internal and external testing sessions were conducted, focusing on usability,
                    registration flow and localisation.
                    Indeed, the app was localised and with a multi-language support in three
                    languages:
                    Italian, English and Spanish.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Technologies</b>
                    <br><br>
                    DriveLink was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and multiple additional
                    frameworks. We combined SwiftUI and UIKit for the app interface, used CallKit framework as a calling
                    system, experimented with CloudKit for the database and persistence aspect of the app and with
                    Firebase Authentication service for sign-in and sign-up.
                    <br>However, the app we developed is currently a demo version only.
                    <br>Making calls has its cost and as far as we looked for a free VoIP service, we had to take a step
                    back, acknowledging our limited resources.
                    <br>We still had the chance to explore external services such as Twilio and SandBird, although we
                    couldn't
                    use none of them for a product aimed at being on the market without an appropriate economic
                    support. <br><br>
                    <b>A note about safety</b>
                    <br><br>
                    An obvious question is: is it safe?
                    <br>For safety reason, the call will always be on speaker. If the user has the earphones on,
                    only
                    one of
                    them will be transmitting sounds, avoiding for the user to be tempted to use both of them with
                    all
                    the
                    associated risks. Furthermore, there will a specific car-mode in the app, where the user can
                    only
                    make calls
                    and can't access any other feature that may be distracting.
                    <br><br>It's worth saying the current version of the app is a demo only.
                    <br>On a broader perspective, it should be part of a future implementations plan making the app
                    work
                    with
                    Siri, using SiriKit framework, to allow the user to make a call in the app just with a vocal
                    command.
                    <br>Another possibility would be turning DriveLink into an app working on Apple's CarPlay only.
                    <br>
                    <br>Additionally, personal informations are not going to be visible to
                    other people on the app, not even during the call, and a
                    Report button will also be available.
