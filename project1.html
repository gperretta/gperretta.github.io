                <div class="body-text">Sprout is an iOS arcade game revolving around a little plant, being
                    the last creature alive on a dying Earth.
                    <br>
                    The game is entirely set in the abandoned "Circumvesuviana" metro station and in a dystopic future.
                    <br>
                    As the sprout is the last and only hope for the planet, the player's mission is to protect it at all
                    cost, by killing
                    the robotic bugs that threaten its existence.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Gameplay and game mechanics</b>
                    <br><br>As the game begins, the player will see the plant going out of its manhole (or
                    <i>sprout-hole</i>) while the robotic bugs will start surrounding the little harmless plant.
                    <br>The player's task is to destroy the incoming bugs by swiping on them in any direction,
                    preventing the enemies
                    from
                    taking away the plant's three lives, represented by its leaves.
                    Each time a bug will get to the plant, the plant will lose a live, retire back in the sprout-hole
                    and them come back up with a leave missing. <br>When the plant will have lost all its leaves,
                    the game is going to end as the sprout dies with the planet Earth last chance of survival.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Challenges and reward/score system</b><br>
                    <br>The game is based on a scoring system, where the player can earn 10 points for each robotic bug
                    destroyed.
                    The more bugs get killed, the higher their score is, while the game progressively becomes more
                    challenging with more enemies appearing and approaching the plant to attack in an increasily faster
                    way.
                    Additionally, the enemies will enter the game scene from different points, decided with a certain
                    quantity of randomness, which means their arrival will be not predictable.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Technologies</b><br>
                    <br>The whole game was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and SpriteKit, an
                    Apple framework to build high-performance and battery-efficient 2D games.
                    <br>Thanks to SpriteKit, we were able to apply physics effects to different objects on the scene,
                    to implement a collision detection system between the plant node and the enemy nodes to acknowledge
                    the
                    attack and to add cool animations both the plant and the moving bugs.
                    <br>The game also contains an
                    opening screen, a lore screen with an animated text resembling a typography effect and, of course, a
                    game over screen, where the final score of the player will be displayed.
                    <br> The highest score will be saved each time using Apple's UserDefaults and then it's going to be
                    showed as a
                    comparison
                    with
                    the last score
                    earned.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Visual and audio</b><br>
                    <br>The whole game is pixel-art-styled with a strong callback to the 80s.
                    <br>All the game assets were created from scratch using Aseprite, a pixel-art tool and image editor.
                    <br>On the other hand, the audio was created by playing real instruments or recording
                    voices and sounds and editing the
                    tracks and noises obtained with Apple's GarageBand.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Process</b><br>
                    <br>Sprout is a product of a two-weeks project in a team of four.
                    <br>We started with a big brainstorming session, which had to be completed in two days to respect
                    the given deadlines. After a research session about feasibility and SpriteKit, a framework we were
                    using for the first time, the game design phase began and briefly after we started coding it.
                    <br>At first, we encountered a few struggles with physics, rigid bodies and collision mask, but
                    working as a team and with the support of official resources and mentors (and some web surfing) we
                    were able to deliver a complete product, with an intuitive backstory and a catchy gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Personal contribution</b><br>
                    <br>
                    As I previously mentioned, Sprout was a team-project, where I worked with another
                    developer and two
                    designers.
                    My main tasks have been:
                    <br>- game scenes and nodes rendering,
                    <br>- core game mechanics implementation with
                    swipe
                    gestures reading,
                    <br>- score system.
                    <br>Sprout was the first game I've developed at the Academy and it was an exciting
                    experience. I had a lot of fun, despite a few struggles with a new framework to learn in a couple of
                    days and a design phase that was a bit different from the process I've been through with app
                    development. I must say, I also had an amazing team, full of really creative thinkers.
