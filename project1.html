        <div class="body-text">Sprout is an iOS arcade game revolving around a little plant, being
          the last creature alive on a dying Earth.
          <br>
          The game is entirely set in an underground metro station and in a dystopic future.
          <br>
          As the sprout is the last and only hope for the planet, the player's mission is to protect it at all
          cost, by killing
          the robotic bugs that threaten its existence.
          <br><br>
          <b>Gameplay and game mechanics</b>
          <br><br>As the game begins, the player will see the plant going out of its manhole (or
          <i>sprout-hole</i>) while the robotic bugs will start surrounding the little harmless plant.
          <br>The player's task is to destroy the incoming bugs by swiping on them in any direction,
          preventing the enemies
          from
          taking away the plant's three lives, represented by its leaves.
          Each time a bug will get to the plant, the plant will lose a live, retire back in the sprout-hole
          and them come back up with a leave missing. <br>When the plant will have lost all its leaves,
          the game is going to end as the sprout dies with the planet Earth last chance of survival.
          <br>
          <br><b>Challenges and reward/score system</b><br>
          <br>The game is based on a scoring system, where the player can earn 10 points for each robotic bug
          destroyed.
          The more bugs get killed, the higher their score is, while the game progressively becomes more
          challenging with more enemies appearing and approaching the plant to attack in an increasily faster
          way.
          Additionally, the enemies will enter the game scene from different points, decided with a certain
          quantity of randomness, which means their arrival will be not predictable.
          <br>
          <br><b>Technologies</b><br>
          <br>The whole game was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and SpriteKit, an
          Apple framework to build high-performance and battery-efficient 2D games.
          <br>Thanks to SpriteKit, we were able to apply physics effects to different objects on the scene,
          to implement a collision detection system between the plant node and the enemy nodes to acknowledge
          the
          attack and to add cool animations both the plant and the moving bugs.
          <br>
          <br><b>Visual and audio</b><br>
          <br>Debug is pixel-art-styled with a strong callback to the 80s.
          <br>
          <br><b>Process</b><br>
          <br>Sprout is a product of a two-weeks project at the Apple Developer Academy. I've been able to work in a
          team of four, with another developer and two designers.
          <br>
          <br><b>Personal contribution</b><br>
          <br>
          My main tasks have been:
          <br>- game scenes and nodes rendering,
          <br>- core game mechanics implementation with
          swipe
          gestures reading,
          <br>- score system.
